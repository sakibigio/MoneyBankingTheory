  abstract = {I develop a search-and-bargaining model of endogenous intermediation in over-the-counter markets. Unlike the existing work, my model allows for rich investor heterogeneity in three simultaneous dimensions: preferences, inventories, and meeting rates. By comparing trading-volume patterns that arise in my model and are observed in practice, I argue that the heterogeneity in meeting rates is the main driver of intermediation patterns. I find that investors with higher meeting rates (i.e., fast investors) are less averse to holding inventories and more attracted to cash earnings, which makes the model corroborate a number of stylized facts that do not emerge from existing models: (i) fast investors provide intermediation by charging a speed premium, and (ii) fast investors hold more extreme inventories. Then, I use the model to study the effect of trading frictions on the supply and price of liquidity. On social welfare, I show that the interaction of meeting rate heterogeneity with optimal inventory management makes the equilibrium inefficient. I provide a financial transaction tax/subsidy scheme that corrects this inefficiency, in which fast investors cross-subsidize slow investors.},

Whereas the existing literature has focused on the special case of two types, we allow agents' utility to be drawn from an arbitrary distribution. Our main contribution is methodological: we provide a solution technique that delivers a complete characterization of the equilibrium, in closed form, both in and out of the steady state. This characterization offers a richer framework for confronting data from real-world markets and reveals a number of new economic insights. In particular, we show that heterogeneity magnifies the impact of frictions on equilibrium outcomes and that this impact is more pronounced on price levels than on price dispersion and welfare.},

In equilibrium, households only use the stock market to smooth consumption; the bond market is inoperative. Furthermore, the cross-sectional distributions of wealth and consumption are not affected by aggregate shocks. These results hold regardless of the persistence of idiosyncratic shocks, even when households face tight solvency constraints. A weaker irrelevance result survives when we allow for predictability in aggregate consumption growth.},

Given the joint process of arbitrage-free asset prices, dividends, and aggregate income, satisfying a certain joint restriction, it is shown that this process is supported in the equilibrium of an economy with judiciously modeled income heterogeneity. The Euler equations of consumption in a representative-agent economy are replaced by a set of Euler equations that depend not only on the per capita consumption growth but also on the cross-sectional variance of the individual consumers' consumption growth.},

In natural environments, we show the economy does not need both: if credit is easy, money is irrelevant; if credit is tight, money is essential, but credit becomes irrelevant. Changes in credit conditions are neutral because real balances respond endogenously to keep total liquidity constant. This is true for both exogenous and endogenous debt limits and policy limits, secured and unsecured lending, and general pricing mechanisms. While we show how to overturn some of these results, the benchmark model suggests credit might matter less than people think.},

The model yields empirically realistic distributions of household wealth and marginal propensities to consume because of two key features: multiple assets with different degrees of liquidity and an idiosyncratic income process with leptokurtic income changes. In this environment, the indirect effects of an unexpected cut in interest rates, which operate through a general equilibrium increase in labor demand, far outweigh direct effects such as intertemporal substitution. This finding is in stark contrast to small- and medium-scale Representative Agent New Keynesian (RANK) economies, where intertemporal substitution drives virtually all of the transmission from interest rates to consumption.},

	loans. The dynamic interaction between credit limits and asset prices
	turns out to be a powerful transmission mechanism by which the effects

	can choose both the amount and maturity of its debt. Bankruptcy is
	determined endogenously rather than by the imposition of a positive
	net worth condition or by a cash flow constraint. The results extend
	Leland's (1994a) closed-form results to a much richer class of possible
	debt structures and permit study of the optimal maturity of debt
	as well as the optimal amount of debt. The model predicts leverage,
	credit spreads, default rates, and writedowns, which accord quite
	closely with historical averages. While short term debt does not
	exploit tax benefits as completely as long term debt, it is more
	likely to provide incentive compatibility between debt holders and
	equity holders. Short term debt reduces or eliminates "asset substitution"
	agency costs. The tax advantage of debt must be balanced against
	bankruptcy and agency costs in determining the optimal maturity of
	the capital structure. The model predicts differently shaped term
	structures of credit spreads for different level of risk. These term
	structures are similar to those found empirically by Sarig and Warga
	(1989). Our results have important implications for bond portfolio
	management. In general, Macaulay duration dramatically overstates
	true duration of risky debt, which may be negative for "junk" bonds.
	Furthermore, the "convexity" of bond prices can become "concavity."},

	analysis of Pareto optima and of competitive equilibria can be applied
	to environments with moral hazard and adverse selection problems.
	Allowing for lotteries, contracts with random components, we first
	establish that an adverse-selection insurance economy, a moral-hazard
	insurance economy, a signaling economy, and a private-information
	labor market economy are all special cases of a simple, general structure.
	We then show that techniques for characterizing Pareto optimal contracts
	as solutions to concave programming problems are useful and nice
	and appear to be broadly applicable; allowing for lotteries, we show
	how to characterize the optimal allocations for the adverse-selection
	insurance and labor market economies. We then show that standard
	existence and optimality theorems for competitive equilibria apply
	in the linear space containing lotteries if agents with characteristics
	which are distinct and privately observed at the time of initial
	trading enter the economy-wide resource constraints in a homogeneous
	way (other kinds of diversity are not critical). For economies with
	moral hazard which satisfy the homogeneity condition, competitive
	contract markets single out a subset of the optima and thus can be
	consistent with apparent unemployment and with a random allocation
	of labor supplied though all households are averse to risk. The adverse-selection
	insurance and signaling economies, however, do not satisfy the homogeneity
	condition and are difficult to decentralize efficiently with a price
	system.},

	We use this focus on asset buyers to explain variation in debt capacity

	in U.S. corporate leverage in the 1980s.},

  abstract = {We estimate the quantity-based monetary policy system in China. We argue that China's rising shadow banking was inextricably linked to banks' balance-sheet risk and hampered the effectiveness of monetary policy on the banking system during the 2009-2015 period of monetary policy contractions. By constructing two micro datasets at the individual bank level, we substantiate this argument with three empirical findings: (1) in response to monetary policy tightening, nonstate banks actively engaged in intermediating shadow banking products; (2) these banks, in sharp contrast to state banks, brought shadow banking products onto the balance sheet via risky investments; (3) bank loans and risky investment assets in the banking system respond in opposite directions to monetary policy tightening, which makes monetary policy less effective.  We build a theoretical framework to derive the above testable hypotheses and explore implications of the interaction between monetary and regulatory policies.},

We study whether corporate spending plans differ conditional on this survey-based measure of financial constraint. Our evidence indicates that constrained firms planned deeper cuts in tech spending, employment, and capital spending. Constrained firms also burned through more cash, drew more heavily on lines of credit for fear banks would restrict access in the future, and sold more assets to fund their operations. We also find that the inability to borrow externally caused many firms to bypass attractive investment opportunities, with 86% of constrained U.S. \{CFOs\} saying their investment in attractive projects was restricted during the credit crisis of 2008. More than half of the respondents said they canceled or postponed their planned investments. Our results also hold in Europe and Asia, and in many cases are stronger in those economies. Our analysis adds to the portfolio of approaches and knowledge about the impact of credit constraints on real firm behavior.},

Macroprudential interventions in financial markets are beneficial because of an aggregate demand externality. Ex post, the distribution of wealth across agents affects aggregate demand and output through Keynesian channels. However, ex ante, these effects are not privately internalized in the financial decisions agents make. We obtain a simple formula that characterizes the size and direction for optimal financial market interventions as a function of a small number of empirically measurable sufficient statistics. We also characterize optimal monetary policy. We then show how to extend our framework to also incorporate financial markets frictions giving rise to pecuniary externalities. Finally, we provide a number of relevant concrete applications of our general theory.},

The paper concludes that such transaction costs lie at the heart of the liquidity effect that enables the Federal Reserve to change the interest rate on a daily basis.},

	in output, employment, and productivity. Thus, uncertainty shocks
	generate short sharp recessions and recoveries. This simulated impact
	of an uncertainty shock is compared to vector autoregression estimations
	on actual data, showing a good match in both magnitude and timing.
	The paper also jointly estimates labor and capital adjustment costs

	We do this by introducing money in the heterogeneous-agent real economy
	of Kiyotaki and Moore (1997). Money enters in a cash-in-advance constraint
	and money supply is managed via open-market operations. We find that
	a monetary shock generates persistent movements in aggregate output,
	the amplitude of which depends upon whether or not debt contracts
	are indexed. If only nominal contracts are traded, money shocks can
	trigger large output fluctuations. In this case a money expansion
	triggers a boom, whereas money contractions generate recessions.
	In contrast, if contracts are indexed then amplification is not only
	smaller; it can also generate the reverse results. When the possibility
	of default and renegotiation is considered, the model can generate
	asymmetric business cycles with recessions milder than booms. Finally,
	monetary shocks generate a highly persistent dampening cycle rather
	than a smoothly declining deviation.},

	may cause illiquidity, in the form of a downward-sloping demand curve
	for the security. The severity of this illiquidity depends upon the
	sensitivity of the value of the issued security to the issuer's private
	information. Thus, the security-design problem involves a tradeoff
	between the retention cost of holding cash flows not included in
	the security design, and the liquidity cost of including the cash
	flows and making the security design more sensitive to the issuer's
	private information. We characterize the optimal security design
	in several cases. We also demonstrate circumstances under which standard
	debt is optimal and show that the riskiness of the debt is increasing
	in the issuer's retention costs for assets.},

	real estate loans, consumer loans, deposits, bank equity, and total

	(the Call Reports) available from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.1
	The Call Reports are quarterly income statement and balance sheet
	data that all federally insured2 banks are required to submit to
	the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). At the aggregate
	level, we construct both a level data set that runs from the first
	quarter of 1976 to the last quarter of 2000 and an index series,
	that corrects for mergers, that runs from the first quarter of 1977
	to the last quarter of 2000. At the regional level we only construct
	the index series that correct for mergers. When banks from different

	change since banks� headquarters report data. Even if the merger
	has caused a substantial change in financial conditions, its importance

	index series because they exclude merging banks in the periods around
	a merger. 3 The data set also includes data for small banks for which

	on private assets provide sufficient liquidity for an efficient functioning
	of the productive sector? Or does the state have a role in creating
	liquidity and regulating it either through adjustments in the stock
	of government securities or by other means? In our model, firms can
	meet future liquidity needs in three ways: by issuing new claims,
	by obtaining a credit line from a financial intermediary, and by
	holding claims on other firms. When there is no aggregate uncertainty,
	we show that these instruments are sufficient for implementing the
	socially optimal (second-best) contract between investors and firms.
	However, the implementation may require an intermediary to coordinate
	the use of scarce liquidity, in which case contracts with the intermediary
	impose both a maximum leverage ratio and a liquidity constraint on
	firms. When there is only aggregate uncertainty, the private sector
	cannot satisfy its own liquidity needs. The government can improve
	welfare by issuing bonds that commit future consumer income. Government
	bonds command a liquidity premium over private claims. The government
	should manage debt so that liquidity is loosened (the value of bonds
	is high) when the aggregate liquidity shock is high and is tightened
	when the liquidity shock is low. The paper thus suggests a rationale
	both for government-supplied liquidity and for its active management.},

  abstract = {I develop a search-and-bargaining model of endogenous intermediation in over-the-counter markets. Unlike the existing work, my model allows for rich investor heterogeneity in three simultaneous dimensions: preferences, inventories, and meeting rates. By comparing trading-volume patterns that arise in my model and are observed in practice, I argue that the heterogeneity in meeting rates is the main driver of intermediation patterns. I find that investors with higher meeting rates (i.e., fast investors) are less averse to holding inventories and more attracted to cash earnings, which makes the model corroborate a number of stylized facts that do not emerge from existing models: (i) fast investors provide intermediation by charging a speed premium, and (ii) fast investors hold more extreme inventories. Then, I use the model to study the effect of trading frictions on the supply and price of liquidity. On social welfare, I show that the interaction of meeting rate heterogeneity with optimal inventory management makes the equilibrium inefficient. I provide a financial transaction tax/subsidy scheme that corrects this inefficiency, in which fast investors cross-subsidize slow investors.},

Whereas the existing literature has focused on the special case of two types, we allow agents' utility to be drawn from an arbitrary distribution. Our main contribution is methodological: we provide a solution technique that delivers a complete characterization of the equilibrium, in closed form, both in and out of the steady state. This characterization offers a richer framework for confronting data from real-world markets and reveals a number of new economic insights. In particular, we show that heterogeneity magnifies the impact of frictions on equilibrium outcomes and that this impact is more pronounced on price levels than on price dispersion and welfare.},

This paper studies interest rate dynamics when payment intermediaries value short bonds as collateral to back inside money. We estimate intermediary Euler equations that relate the short safe rate to other interest rates as well as intermediary leverage and portfolio risk. Towards the end of economic booms, the short rate set by the central bank disconnects from other interest rates: as collateral becomes scarce and spreads widen, payment intermediaries reduce leverage, and increase portfolio risk. We document stable business cycle relationships between spreads, leverage, and the safe portfolio share of payment intermediaries that are consistent with the model. Structural changes, especially in regulation, induce low frequency shifts, such as after the financial crisis.},

In equilibrium, households only use the stock market to smooth consumption; the bond market is inoperative. Furthermore, the cross-sectional distributions of wealth and consumption are not affected by aggregate shocks. These results hold regardless of the persistence of idiosyncratic shocks, even when households face tight solvency constraints. A weaker irrelevance result survives when we allow for predictability in aggregate consumption growth.},

In natural environments, we show the economy does not need both: if credit is easy, money is irrelevant; if credit is tight, money is essential, but credit becomes irrelevant. Changes in credit conditions are neutral because real balances respond endogenously to keep total liquidity constant. This is true for both exogenous and endogenous debt limits and policy limits, secured and unsecured lending, and general pricing mechanisms. While we show how to overturn some of these results, the benchmark model suggests credit might matter less than people think.},
